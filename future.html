     <p> What I want to do in my future is be in the NBA. I want to become an NBA player because I love to play basketball and I am willing to work hard and push through all the challenges that come my way to make. I have a determination to atleast try.Yeah if I don't make it, it will be disappointing but still I will know that I tried by best and did all I could have to get there.Another thing I am focused on being when I grow up and for my future is being a lawyer because my mom say's that I'm a good negotiator and that I can do it and make it. Also because my mom is inspiring me to do it because that was her dream and is currently working on it so that she can fulfill her dream as being a lawyer. </p>
