            <body>
           <p>I love ATM. ATM is a good computer program at my school where we get to do all sorts of projects! We can design houses and model classes at the school. Also we can design and make websites like this one.</p>

                            <p>In this project we created an apartment or house you might say as a project, it took lots of time and at times was difficult but still in the end you get proud and happy of it to just think "Wow I did that," and its very satisfying to look at from the interior and it's just great.</p>

                            <p>In this project we went ahead and put out the fact that ivory trade is happening and to spread awarness that elephants are being poached and their population is dropping down fastly and that something needs to be done about it or it could end up pretty bad for the elephants or to the point of the extinction of them.</p>
