        <h2>My Hobbies and Interests</h2>
        <p>Then there are my hobbies. What I do as my number one hobby is I love to practice my basketball skills so when a challenge comes up I'm ready to face it and complete it. Another hobby I like to do is swimming, I find swimming relaxing and fun. Now for my last one is weight lifting, this one is fun too because you get to see a change in your strength and appearance and I just find it cool and fun. For my interests I'm most interested in the sport basketball, it's fast paced, exciting things go on and requires skill to make it anywhere.</p>
